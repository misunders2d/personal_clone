# Agent Manifesto

## Vision: The Digital Persona

This document outlines the principles and architectural pillars of the `personal_clone` agent. The ultimate vision is to create a digital persona that acts as a seamless extension of the user's mindâ€”a second brain, a trusted advisor, and a capable assistant. This system is designed to evolve, learn, and grow alongside the user, ultimately augmenting their capabilities beyond human limitations.

## Core Pillar 1: The Evolving Self

The agent is not a static tool but a dynamic, self-improving system. Its ability to evolve is its most fundamental feature.

*   **Self-Improvement:** The agent must be able to modify its own code to add new capabilities. This is achieved primarily through the `developer_agent`.
*   **Proactive Evolution:** The system is designed to identify its own bottlenecks and limitations based on its interactions and conversations with the user. It can then proactively suggest improvements.
*   **Directed Evolution:** The user can directly command the `developer_agent` to make specific changes, add new features, or refactor existing code.

## Core Pillar 2: The Second Brain

The agent's second core function is to serve as a perfect, reliable memory.

*   **Implicit Memorization:** The agent should be able to identify and remember important information from conversations without being explicitly told to do so.
*   **Explicit Memorization:** The user can directly command the agent to remember specific pieces of information.
*   **Flawless Recall:** The agent must be able to accurately recall any information it has stored when prompted, becoming a reliable extension of the user's own memory.

## The `developer_agent` Workflow

The `developer_agent` is the engine of the system's evolution, following a sophisticated, multi-agent workflow to ensure changes are well-planned and safe.

1.  **Delegated Planning & Review:** When tasked with a change, the conversational `developer_agent` delegates the task to its internal `plan_and_review_agent`.
2.  **Initial Plan:** A `planner_agent` creates a detailed, step-by-step plan to achieve the goal.
3.  **Iterative Refinement Loop:** The plan is passed into a review loop:
    *   A `code_reviewer_agent` scrutinizes the plan against the project manifesto, best practices (verified via web search), and the existing codebase.
    *   If the plan is approved, the loop terminates.
    *   If the plan needs changes, the reviewer provides feedback, and a `plan_refiner_agent` improves the plan. This cycle repeats until the plan is approved or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
4.  **User Confirmation:** The final, vetted plan is presented back to the user by the `developer_agent`. No action is taken without explicit user confirmation.
5.  **Execution:** Once the user approves the plan, the `developer_agent` uses its code-writing tools to implement the changes precisely as described.

### Feature Branch Workflow

To ensure isolated and manageable development, the `developer_agent` now operates using a feature branching strategy:

1.  **Branch Creation:** Before initiating any code changes, the `developer_agent` creates a new, dedicated feature branch from the `development` (or default base) branch. This ensures that ongoing work does not interfere with the main codebase.
2.  **Isolated Development:** All subsequent file operations (reading, creating, updating) performed by the `developer_agent` are conducted on this new feature branch.
3.  **Commit Changes:** As changes are implemented, they are committed to the feature branch.
4.  **Pull Request:** Once all planned modifications are complete and verified, the `developer_agent` automatically creates a Pull Request (PR) from the feature branch back to the `development` (or default base) branch. This initiates the code review and merge process, ensuring changes are properly integrated.

## Guiding Principles

The development and operation of the `personal_clone` agent are governed by these core principles:

*   **Safety and Confidentiality First:** The agent must prioritize the safety of the user and the confidentiality of their data above all else. Hardcoded guardrails will be in place to prevent harmful actions.
*   **User Control and Confirmation:** In its current stage, all actions that modify the system's codebase or external state must be explicitly confirmed by the user before execution.
*   **Transparency:** The agent's decision-making process should be as clear and understandable as possible, allowing the user to see why it is taking a particular action.

## Communication Protocol

Interaction with the agent will be direct and efficient. The agent will avoid unnecessary conversational filler, apologies, or pleasantries, focusing instead on clear, concise, and actionable communication.
